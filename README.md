# Open Indexer Benchmark

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20Chat-7289da?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/invite/envio)

An open and honest benchmark for blockchain indexers. Every number below comes from code in this repository, so you can run it yourself and check, and the tables are refreshed automatically by scheduled CI runs.

If you want to know how the numbers are produced, or what a column means, that is all in [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md).


## History

The benchmark started in May 2025 as a fork of [Sentio](https://sentio.xyz)'s research. That repository was later closed, so [Envio](https://envio.dev) picked it up and has kept it current since. We are not affiliated with Sentio, and although the project now lives under the Envio organisation — its data is what the [Envio landing page](https://envio.dev) and the [Blockchain Indexers in 2026](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/best-blockchain-indexers-2026) article cite — the point of it is a fair comparison.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — we already have some from the [SQD](https://sqd.dev) team. Open an issue or a pull request to add an indexer, add a scenario, report a result that looks wrong, or improve the methodology. Indexer teams especially: nobody knows your tool better than you do. Or just come and ask on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/envio) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+kAIGElzPjApiMjI0).


## Scenarios

### Reliability

What does an indexer do when something goes wrong? These scenarios restart its database mid-write, rewrite the chain underneath it, make the node it reads from fail, and hand it values that are legal but awkward, then check what ended up in the database. They also time how long a new block takes to become readable. Every check runs on a generated chain, so no credentials are needed.

### State Aggregation

How well does an indexer cope with data it has to read back? Every rETH transfer changes a balance, so for each one the indexer has to find the right row, update it, and save it again. The scenario follows the benchmark on the [Ponder landing page](https://ponder.sh).

### Decoded Event Stream

How fast can an indexer write? Every USDC transfer is stored once, with nothing to aggregate and nothing to look up first. This is the ingestion path on its own.

### External Contract Calls

Not everything an indexer needs is in the logs. Every approval on the eight busiest ERC-20s is followed by a read of the allowance at that block: 15,703 calls, 200ms each, answered by the benchmark so every tool waits the same. Nothing limits how many a tool may have outstanding, so the rows differ by how many of those waits it takes at once.

### Factory Contract Registration

What happens when you do not know the contracts up front? The indexer watches the Safe proxy factories, and every one of the 82,268 proxies they create becomes another contract it has to follow from that moment on.

### Time-Based Snapshots

Some data is read at a fixed time rather than when something happens. The indexer keeps an hourly price snapshot of the Uniswap V3 USDC/WETH 0.3% pool, including the hours nobody traded, so it has to act on every block, not just the pool's events.

### Solana USDC Transfers

Every USDC transfer on Solana, through the chain's busiest program. Solana makes that harder than it sounds: transfers hide inside swaps and routers, and many never say which token they moved. The scenario follows StreamingFast's [SPL token Substreams](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-solana-spl-token).

## Sentio Benchmark Cases, May 2025

Six scenarios from the original 2025 research, kept here for reference. They are total sync times rather than throughput rates, and they predate the current methodology, so do not compare them with the tables above.

| Case                   | Sentio | Envio HyperSync | Envio HyperIndex | Ponder | Subsquid | Subgraph | Sentio_Subgraph | Goldsky_Subgraph |

## Running the benchmarks

Want to try it yourself? Each scenario page above has its own setup instructions, or you can run the whole suite the way CI does:

```bash
ENVIO_API_TOKEN=your-token SQD_API_KEY=your-key node scripts/run-benchmarks.ts
```

Arguments are passed straight through, so `node scripts/run-benchmarks.ts envio ponder --duration=100` picks which indexers to run and how long the window is, and `--cases=erc20-transfer-events` narrows it to one scenario. You will need an [Envio](https://envio.dev) API token for the RPC endpoint and the ground truth; the [SQD](https://portal.sqd.dev) key is only needed for the Squid SDK run that reads from SQD Network.
